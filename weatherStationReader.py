This function is used to update the table. There are two seperate tables, one for PHP to read the current data, and the other
is a log of all of the weather data for that specific day. The current_Weather table will only store one value. As you do not want php to have
to read a million values as it loops through. The second table is a complete log of all of the weather data from that day. This
data, at least in my case, will be used to plot graphs.

Function updateTable takes arguments tableList, which is all of the tables to be updated to, and c, an annoying variable I had to 
add because of local and global variable issues.

The function will write data to two tables.
