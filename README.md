# piWeatherStation
A weather station that I programmed for my Raspberry Pi. 

The program gets the temperature, pressure, percent humidity, and change in temperature based off of a SENSEHAT reader. 

Python then uploads this data remotely to a mySQL database. 

Following that, my website reads the data in PHP and displays the data.

Feel free to use base your code off of mine. However, any use of my code that is directly coppied and claimed to be there own is not
allowed.
